# Hello-hostname

This very little node.js app is a demo app in order to test containers and container systems with load balancers and so on.

It is a silly app that runs an httpd server that shows a hostname info if it is accessed in 8080 port.

(This is s2i formated to be used with Openshift for demostration purposes)
